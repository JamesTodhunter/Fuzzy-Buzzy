Getting Started with my React App
This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.
once you clone the repositery from git hub
you are gonna run npm install wait till that is done,
and will open a intergarted server and cd into the server and run npm run dev,
then open a different intergrated terminal and cd into Fuzzy-Buzzy and 
run npm start and there you go you can now use my app on your local machine.
!!!!Important note you will need PgAdmin4 for the server side!!!!!

Fuzzy Buzzy is a app to help those who want to dip their toes into the relm of DND
you can search up to 316 spells from a 3rd party DND 5E API and save them to a database and fromm there create comments on those saved items if you wish or make a comment on your favortie cocktail who am I to tell you what to do just a guy who has screamed more at his computer in the last 12 hours than I have in my whole life. 

my target audience is more focused on those entering the relm of DND but it isn't limited to just newcomers so if you like my app send me a <3 in a message hearts are alway's welcome.

npm run eject
!!!!!!!Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back!!!!!!1

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

if you want to build your own app try {

    run npx creat-react-app app-name(You can name it anything in the app-name)

Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:
npm install react-router-dom, this will help with creating routes between your pages in react,
you can google other react libaries so shop around before setting your sights on my example
}
